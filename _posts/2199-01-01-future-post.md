I am thrilled to announce that our project, StoryAI, advanced in the NSF-sponsored VITAL Prize Challenge Semi-Final Round. In addition to receiving $20,000 for developing a prototype, our team has been matched with a teacher mentor who received $15,000 to work with our team. Currently, we are co-designing the learning application as a team of four (Ariel Han (design lead/ lead researcher), Shenshen Han (tech lead/ programmer), Dr. Seth Corrigan, and Dr. Kylie Peppler).
