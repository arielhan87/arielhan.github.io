I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the University of California, Irvine informatics department, where I work at the [Creativity Labs](http://creativitylabs.com/) and [Connected Learning Lab](https://connectedlearning.uci.edu/), advised by [Dr. Kylie Peppler](http://kpeppler.com/). I received a master's in [Entertainment Technology Center](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/) from Carnegie Mellon University and Information science, Industrial design, and Fine arts from Seoul National University. ​

My research interests focus on the intersection of AI, educational technology, learning sciences, and HCI. I investigate fundamental questions on how people interact and collaborate with AI-powered tools and agents to empower teaching and learning. My current research focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art technologies for inclusive learning and teaching and how Generative AI (NLPs, Text-to-Image generators(TTL)) can be safely and effectively designed to scale playful, child-centered learning tailored to each student’s needs. I design, develop, and evaluate AI-powered learning technology to support creative expression and literacy development through writing with AI agents and examine how these AI technologies play the role of learning companions for children’s growth.
